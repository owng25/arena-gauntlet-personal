	"Intro": "In the glittering realm of Crystal Shores, where crystal fragments jut from the beach and float in the sky, many strange and powerful Illuvials call this peculiar, shimmering landscape home. Among them is the Tatopee, a small, sleepy snail-like creature with a rough, cragged shell. Its skin is a soft pink, blending in with the glowing light that emanates from beneath its shell, while its underbelly is a pale yellow in contrast to the darkness of its armour.",
	"Summary": "In the luminous Crystal Shores, the Tatopee, a small snail-like creature, blends into the shimmering landscape with its pink skin and cragged shell. Its shell is pieced together from rocks and meteorites, shooting deadly lithic projectiles at intruders with remarkable precision.The Tatopee collects and rearranges its favorite rocks, synthesizing its shell using absorbed minerals. Its shell is incredibly hard and buoyant, while its unique skin allows it to glide easily over surfaces, as it marks territory with mucus trails.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Tatopee has wrinkly bags under its eyes, and its skin is a soft pink that blends in with the glowing light that emanates from beneath its rough and cragged shell. Its underbelly is a pale yellow in contrast to the darkness of its armour. The Tatopee's shell appears to be pieced together, with three holes from which it shoots deadly lithic projectiles.",
		"Behaviour": "The Tatopee is a grumpy and territorial creature, known for its quick temper and tendency to blast rocks at any other Illuvial that dares to pass by, even if they keep their distance. Despite its aggressive behaviour, the Tatopee is also quite diligent about picking up any fallen projectiles and is known to become attached to its favourite rocks and meteorites, rearranging its shell and ammo to use the material in different ways. It is capable of synthesizing its shell by absorbing minerals that it grounds with its lower body. The Tatopee hunts by shooting at Morphopods."

		"Kol": [
			"The Tatopee constructs its shell by collecting pieces of rock and meteorite and then combining them with psionic energy.",
			"The Tatopee leaves behind a trail of mucus to mark its territory and avoid others of its kind.",
			"The Tatopee has fast reflexes and shoots at anything that breaches its territory, from Morphopods to leaves, or on rare occasions, even lightning."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Tatopee's shell is made of iron and enriched calcium carbonate that is extremely hard and resistant to wear and tear.",
			"The Tatopee's skin contains a unique chemical compound that acts as a natural lubricant, allowing it to move easily through the water and over rough surfaces.",
			"The Tatopee's rocky projectiles are infused with an enzyme that triggers combustion and increases their destructive power.",
			"The Tatopee has air cavities within its shell which allow it to increase its buoyancy in water.",
			"The Tatopee secretes a slime-like mucus which functions as an adhesive that enables it to move up vertical surfaces and upside-down across horizontal surfaces."
