	"Intro": "Among colourful pools and the bright vegetation of Halcyon Sea, there is a plethora of life swimming, crawling, and climbing all around. Ears of coral and rocks jut out of the cliffside, overlooking a beautiful blue waterfall. Some unlucky visitors may take a wrong step and tumble down the vast currents, only to receive a breath of life through the healing pulse of the Virtuous Lynx.",
	"Summary": "The Virtuous Lynx inhabits the vibrant ecosystem of Halcyon Sea, where it acts as a compassionate healer among the diverse life forms. With a coat of bluish-grey and white fur, adorned by spear-like ears holding a glowing energy orb, it radiates a gentle yet powerful presence. This Illuvial uses its empathic antennas to sense distress and responds by emitting restorative waves of energy to heal and rejuvenate others. It also absorbs nutrients from the environment to sustain its healing abilities.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Virtuous Lynx has a coat of bluish-grey and white, with long ears that end in spear-like wisps. Its ears lean forward and hold between them a glowing ball of energy, with life-giving abilities that it shares with those who gaze upon its soothing blue eyes. The Virtuous Lynx travels on four legs, but never uses its claws to attack. The gem suspended between its ears holds a sublime power and carries a great weight every time its energy is whirled out.",
		"Behaviour": "The Virtuous Lynx lowers its head when it encounters Illuvials that are sick or injured, ready to revitalize their body, mind, and spirit. It makes a noise of encouragement and sends out waves of restorative energy in a benevolent gesture. However, the Virtuous Lynx's life-giving acts are only one side to this gentle Illuvial abilities. It may appear unassuming with its soft steps but it is always on the lookout for overgrown plants or nutrient-filled reserves to absorb their vitality. It stores excessive energy within its gem and feeds it to those who need it more."

			"The Virtuous Lynx has been observed slinking gracefully around Halcyon Sea and exploring its many pools, often taking dips in and soaking up the nutrients.",
			"When the Virtuous Lynx encounters many Illuvials in need of help, it calls out to others of its kind with a unique cry to summon them. The Virtuous Lynxes amplify each other's healing abilities, creating wave after wave of restorative energy."

		"Buckley": [
			"The Virtuous Lynx's ears function as empathic antennas that can sense distress in other Illuvials.",

			"The Virtuous Lynx secretes nutrients from its paws that may be absorbed by local flora and fauna.",
			"The Virtuous Lynx's ears and nose have specialised receptors that are hyper-attuned to biological changes, including heartbeats, hormonal shifts, illness, and injury.",
			"The Virtuous Lynx has a unique, dual-layered fur coat that functions in symbiosis with microbes which are capable of absorbing nutrients from its environment."
