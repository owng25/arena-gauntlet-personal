	"Intro": "The mystical region of Crystal Shores shimmers and shines like no other. Among the dazzling lights reflected off the crystal shards, one may miss the muted shine of the Exalted Earth Fliish. Its ringed tail holds a small piece of rounded crystal, which twinkles when it is communicating with another of its kind. It is especially attuned to the light of its species, which blinks in warning when a dangerous Illuvial is sighted.",
	"Summary": "The Exalted Earth Fliish inhabits the dazzling Crystal Shores, blending in with the shimmering crystals and communicating through the twinkling of its ringed tail crystal. This earth-affinity creature has a purple and pink body, orange eyes, and a trident-shaped crown, using its sticky feet to climb surfaces despite often losing grip due to sand. It toughens its skin to rock-like hardness, sharpens its horns on crystals, and camouflages by synchronizing its tail light.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Exalted Earth Fliish is purple and pink, with orange eyes and a wide gaping mouth, its long, translucent tongue dangling out from the side. It has round bumpy toes on its feet, and its hind legs are often bent in a crouch. Upon its head, lining the upper side of its big eyes is a trident-shaped crown made of dark, horned protrusions. Its tail is lined with rock that forms a ring at its end, glowing pink on the inside with floating fragments of crystal.",
		"Behaviour": "The Exalted Earth Fliish spends the least time in water compared to other types of Fliish. It can often be found hopping in crystal caves, leaping beneath sandfalls or ascending time-stuck, floating plants. The Exalted Earth Fliish has sticky feet which act as an adhesive to the diagonal surfaces it climbs. However, it often gets lots of sand stuck on them and loses its grip. Fortunately, its helmeted head is more resilient to falls than others of its kind. This Illuvial can be found with its tongue sticking out, searching for Morphopods in crystal cavities and holes in the ground."

		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Exalted Earth Fliish's eyes are capable of detecting the electromagnetic field of crystals, allowing it to navigate its environment based on land formations.",
			"The Exalted Earth Fliish has mirror neurons that allow it to coordinate its behavior with others of its kind.",
			"The Exalted Earth Fliish's horned head has scarring and marks that are likely produced through tussling with its own kind.",
			"The ringed tail of the Exalted Earth Fliish is capable of vibrating at varying frequencies, likely as complex signals that it uses to communicate with others of its kind.",
			"The Exalted Earth Fliish has mineral-rich armor that enables it to regulate its temperature."
