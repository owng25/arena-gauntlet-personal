	"Intro": "The prism structures in Crystal Shores form pink pillars and purple caverns. Deep in the cave system, beyond the passages that become narrower and spikier, a secret paradise awaits. Past a massive sandfall, time-stuck floating plants cover the floors and walls. Even the softer whisper in this oasis echoes back from the walls, and the Lesser Earth Doka pounding against the jagged walls sounds deafening.",
	"Summary": "The Lesser Earth Doka, a sturdy Illuvial with dark purple fur and bright amethyst markings, is known for its powerful fists and thick tail. It trains by striking structures and engaging in battles, glowing more vibrantly with each victory. Notable features include mineral-coated fists, a powerful punching mechanism, sensitive tail, and an endocrine system that boosts endorphins and adrenaline during intense activity.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Lesser Earth Doka is a stocky Illuvial with a flat head, sturdy fists, and two feet planted firmly on the ground. It has dark purple fur with a white underbelly, and its face is illuminated by bright amethyst markings above and under its eyes. Growing from its head to the small of its back are longer, thicker tendrils of hair. They are dark at the roots with vibrant highlights, shining with the same light from the Lesser Earth Doka's claws when it strikes. Wide-set and packed with muscles, this fighter Illuvial has a slight belly and a thick tail to match. ",
		"Behaviour": "The Lesser Earth Doka stands with its knees bent, hopping in place with its fists ready to strike. It can be found taking swings at various structures, determined to shake fruits and Morphopods from their perch for its next meal. The Lesser Earth Doka often trains with others of its kind, exchanging blows and practising its jumps. The more battles a Lesser Earth Doka wins, the more vibrant it shines. Ones that are drained of colour must spend prolonged time regrowing their strength. At the end of the year, the Lesser Earth Dokas that are the brightest form trios and train together."

	"Facts": {
		"Kol": [
			"The Lesser Earth Doka fights regularly with others of its kind as well as those outside its species. It hops in place and sometimes psyches its opponent out with false moves, only to strike from another direction.",
			"The Lesser Earth Doka has remarkably strong fists that can break down the sturdiest defences. However, its tail is a point of vulnerability. Unlike other Illuvials, it does not use its tail to fight and becomes disoriented if it is struck from behind.",
			"The Lesser Earth Doka can enter a fighting frenzy, its facial markings and claws glowing brighter as its strikes repeatedly at its target."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Lesser Earth Doka's fists are coated with minerals and chitin, which redistribute stresses evenly over the surface and increase its resilience.",
			"The Lesser Earth Doka has a weighted compression mechanism in its bicep which allows it to lock its arm in and release for maximum impact. It is connected to the air vents in its knuckles, enabling a powerful punch.",
			"The Lesser Earth Doka's tail has many nerve endings that make it extra sensitive to vibrations in its environment.",
			"The Lesser Earth Doka has microscopic hair on its feet that helps it stick to surfaces, allowing it to maintain its balance.",
			"The Lesser Earth Doka's endocrine system has a mechanism for releasing 5x more endorphins and adrenaline than the average Illuvial during periods of high activity."
