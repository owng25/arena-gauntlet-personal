	"DisplayDescription": "Exalted Water Volante rakes its claws at the target, dealing <AttackPhysicalDamage>950</> (<OmegaPowerPercentage></>) Physical Damage and Silencing it for 2 second.\r\n\r\nDamage: <AttackPhysicalDamage>950</> (<OmegaPowerPercentage></>)",
	"Intro": "The pristine waters of Halcyon Sea are so full of nutrients and life, it is said to absorb the pain of the injured. Every year, massive swarms of the Exalted Water Volante travel along the coasts and leap into the sea. Swimming at the surface, they engage in mass battle. Their numbers dwindle as many die off or are forced to defuse to survive. Only the triumphant victors maintain their status as the Exalted Water Volante.",
	"Summary": "The nutrient-rich waters of Halcyon Sea attract massive swarms of Exalted Water Volantes each year, where they engage in mass battles before the victors choose fusion partners. These slender blue Illuvials, with flat heads, yellow eyes, and bright orange stripes, possess webbed limbs and sharp yellow fins. Adapted for survival, they have unique features like a siphon-like tail for jet propulsion, toxin-absorbing markings, and mineral-storing capabilities that support their active and communal lifestyle.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Exalted Water Volante has a flat head with beady yellow eyes, with bright orange stripes protruding along its slender blue body. There are webbed membranes between its thin, stick-like limbs and a sharp yellow fin rises from its orange-coated back. Its slim tail curls up behind it, dark blue stripes dripping in water. With big, chunky white claws on its feet, the Exalted Water Volante can spring across far distances on nimble legs. Its striped membranes help it glide in air and water.",
		"Behaviour": "The Exalted Water Volante stays hidden for most of the year, sleeping in a cocoon made of its own mucus. However, when the time is right, it gathers in huge numbers, travelling to the sea and gliding just above the water with its tail whipping beneath the surface. They emerge from distant caves and pools to the same coast and hunt in unison during Morphopod breeding season. Even bigger and stronger creatures that are caught in between can be swept away. After the coral dust is settled, the Exalted Water Volantes rest in harmony, floating in the water together."

	"Facts": {
		"Kol": [
			"The Exalted Water Volante glides through the air just above the water, whipping its tail beneath the surface. It can propel itself forward by shooting out beams of water from its tail.",
			"The Exalted Water Volante hides from predators by swimming just below the surface with its yellowfin protruding out. Its large fin tricks land Illuvials into thinking that it is a larger creature and its belly lightens to camouflage with the light of the surface to underwater predators.",
			"The Exalted Water Volante are attracted to pools with a large variety of minerals. It can be observed combing the shore for shells and colourful rocks, gathering them into its pool as a display of its status to others of its kind."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Exalted Water Volante has a siphon-like adaptation in its tail with multiple pipes that allows it to intake water and use jet propulsion in order to propel itself forward.",
			"The Exalted Water Volante's stomach has a coating of clay that protects it from the toxins of poison-secreting plants.",
			"The Exalted Water Volante's bright orange markings store any excess toxins it absorbs from its environment.",
			"The Exalted Water Volante has mineral stores in its body and an extensive digestive system that transforms them into usable energy. They are connected to tear ducts that allow the Exalted Water Volante to remove excess minerals by crying them out.",
			"The Exalted Water Volante has a swim bladder that allows it to control its buoyancy and membranes along its body that extend its surface area. When used together, it is capable of gliding above the water."
