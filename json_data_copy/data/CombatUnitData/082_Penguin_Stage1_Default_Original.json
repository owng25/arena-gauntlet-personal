	"Intro": "In Taiga Boreal, geysers can burst through the frozen landscape without any warning. Ice and snow form plateaus and bridges, many of which may collapse from the sudden movement. Massive sheets of ice float about, shifting directions with the currents under them. The sound of cracking ice and splashing is common, but not always for the reason you'd think. It could very well be the Slappin running around, showing off its elaborate dance.",
	"Summary": "The Slappin is a graceful creature with a sleek black-feathered coat adorned by icy arms and distinctive yellow antlers. It uses its blade-like arms to manipulate water, creating waterfalls and shaping the icy landscape for its dance performances. The Slappin glides and dances across frozen lakes, occasionally causing fractures with its enthusiastic displays. It hunts morphopods by drilling through ice and can generate powerful currents with its tail, capable of breaking thick ice sheets.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Slappin has a sleek feathered coat of black, with white on its belly and cheeks, and ice coating its arms. Its torso and head are soft and round, but every other part of it is sharp and elaborate. Its arms end in pointed icicles, with streams of water that run along them. Streaks of blue wrap around its shoulders, back, and the top of its eyes, forming a fascinating pattern. The Slappin has yellow antlers that grow from the base of its beak, following the curvature of its face like an ornament. Waving in high spirits, its tail is a water curl, fanning out into many droplet ends.",
		"Behaviour": "The Slappin's yellow eyes twinkle with amusement as it waves its blade-like arms around. It is capable of pulling water out of glaciers, creating fissures that form little waterfalls. Over time, the Slappin creates structures out of the icescape that serves as a stage for its ritualistic dance. Sometimes it can get carried away with its displays, fracturing the ice floor with its bladed arms. It loves to dance and glide along the frozen lake."

		"Kol": [
			"The Slappin has the ability to manipulate water with the movement of its arms and tail. If there is a group of Slappin waving their tails, it can cause currents big enough to break through thick ice.",
			"The Slappin can be found gliding on ice sheets that move along the currents it creates.",
			"The Slappin loves to dance so much that it ignores the dangers around it just to bring its practised choreography to completion."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Slappin has an internal hydraulic system that uses suction in order to move large quantities of water from its external environment onto its body.",
			"The Slappin is capable of drilling holes in the ice to hunt for morphopods swimming beneath the crust, as evidenced by a scan of its digestive tract.",
			"The Slappin's yellow antlers are sense organs that can detect vibrations in the water which allows them to locate Morphopods underwater.",
			"The Slappin's arms are coated with ice that is infused with an Osvium-Tellevium compound, making them lightweight and adaptable to its movements.",
			"The Slappin's fur insulation is so strong that it requires contact with lower temperatures to cool itself down."
