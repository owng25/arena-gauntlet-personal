	"Intro": "In the twinkling tunnels and floating crystal islands of Crystal Shores, an acrobatic presence catches the eye. Sunbeams bounce off shard walls and prism-like plants, occasionally illuminating a blur of motion - a Grilla in action. From nimble youngsters to imposing elders, these remarkable beings navigate the treacherous terrain with unparalleled agility, their blade-like appendages and prehensile tails defining their unmistakable silhouette.",
	"Summary": "The Grilla appears in three distinct forms, each perfectly adapted to its environment. The smallest is incredibly agile and playful, while the largest is a formidable presence with scythe-like arms. Each form is characterised by increasing size, sharpness of appendages, and complexity of armour. The Grilla's fur varies from sleek grey to striking red, with bioluminescent patterns growing more intricate in larger specimens. These creatures display acrobatic social behaviours that turns simple communication into an impressive performance.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Grilla's physiology is a marvel of precision. The smallest Grillas have nimble, grey bodies with dark rocky armour and sharp blade-like appendages. Their long tails glow crystal pink underneath plated armour. Mid-sized Grillas develop white fur with purple markings, sporting impressive spikes on their hands and a curved javelin on their tails. The largest Grillas are adorned with striking red fur, black stripes, and formidable scythe-like arms. Their tails end in dominating jagged pikes, and their heads are crowned with inward-curving horns tipped with liquid crystal. All Grillas possess eyes that emit a pink glow, serving both as a light source and a means to project holographic images. As they increase in size, they develop more complex bioluminescent patterns, with the largest sporting a crown-like structure that regulates their considerable energy reserves.",
		"Behaviour": "The Grilla's behavior changes with its size. The smallest are masters of acrobatics, often seen walking on their hands, leaping off tunnel walls, and playing games by throwing crystal shards. They gather in groups, challenging one another with daring feats of agility. Mid-sized Grillas are more solitary and always in motion. They use their tails to sharpen their body spikes and can pierce crystal walls to aid in climbing. These Grillas are highly attuned to their environment, always ready to leap away at a moment's notice. The largest Grillas display the most complex behavior. They strategically explore underground routes, using their tails to anchor themselves and their sharp arms to carve new pathways. They may assist smaller creatures trapped in difficult areas, though their patience for noisy companions is limited. Despite their varying sizes, all Grillas share a love for acrobatic displays and a constant need for motion. They use their sharp appendages for mobility and defense, but also for manipulating their environment and even creating art through holographic projections."

	"Facts": {
		"Kol": [
			"The Exalted Grilla is an excellent climber with many tactics to support its movement. Sometimes, it uses its agile tail to pierce through rock and support its entire weight as it carves into cave walls with its sharp hands, making better handholds.",
			"The Exalted Grilla relies on smaller Illuvials to aid its grooming because its scythe-like hands cannot coordinate delicate movements without inflicting damage. In return, it offers protection from predators.",
			"The Exalted Grilla is quick on its feet and often seems to disappear when it leaps only to reappear elsewhere."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Exalted Grilla's thick fur is covered in plates of dermal armour composed of rock, bone, and traces of the mineral Rubivium, which is responsible for the red colouration in its fur.",
			"The Exalted Grilla has a strong and flexible tail with a spear-like blade at the end of its tail that can pierce through solid crystal rock.",
			"The Exalted Grilla has dense muscle fibres that help it support the large blades upon its arms without strain or injury.",
			"The Exalted Grilla has a specialised organ which it uses to manage the radioactive energy in its body. It is connected to a network of adapted capillaries which release energy through its crown and its arms.",
			"The Exalted Grilla has adapted stores of cartilage and fatty tissue within its rock-like plates which allow it to manipulate the density of its armour to optimize for a variety of situations."
