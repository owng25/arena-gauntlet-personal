	"Intro": "Blue skies, green fields, and large rolling clouds are all hallmarks of Brightland Steppes. A gentle breeze rustles the grass and sends ripples through the ponds. Alongside drifting seeds and bubbles, the Exalted Air Volante glides with the wind, using the thin membranes between its limbs to soar. With a flick of its tail, the Exalted Air Volante gives itself an extra boost to fly towards its destination.",
	"Summary": "This slender turquoise Illuvial with red eyes and webbed limbs uses wind blasts from its curled tail to boost its flight. The Exalted Air Volante is an aerial hunter, adept at pursuing floating bubbles and Morphopods, and can manipulate wind to aid its movements and attacks. Notably, it can leap at high speeds, render itself invisible while accelerating, and use bristle-like structures on its feet for stabilization.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Exalted Air Volante has beady red eyes, a flat head, and a slender turquoise body with webbed membranes between its thin, stick-like limbs. Spikey, white-tipped tendrils stick up from its teal-coloured head and back. Its slim tail curls up, capable of manipulating the blast of wind that it shoots out from behind. The Exalted Air Volante has big, chunky claws on its feet and it can spring across far distances with its nimble legs. Its striped membranes help it glide in the air as it moves.",
		"Behaviour": "The Exalted Air Volante can often be found gliding above the fields of Brightland Steppes. Attracted to floating bubbles, it pursues them with determination, catching Morphopods and seeds that often get stuck within these lightweight orbs. As an aerial hunter, it can use change directions quickly to latch onto its target and uses blasts of air to flatten the grass and find Morphopods hiding inside. When the Exalted Air Volante sends out a particularly powerful blast of air from its tail, it must replenish its supply by drawing in wind energy from its feet."

			"The Exalted Air Volante is capable of leaping at high speeds and teleporting across vast distances.",
			"The Exalted Air Volante has tendrils on its back that tremble when wind speeds pick up.",

		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Exalted Air Volante's scales contain a mysterious substance which is linked to its ability to render itself invisible while it accelerates to its destination.",
			"The Exalted Air Volante's spines have receptors adapted to determine wind speeds and direction, allowing it to better coordinate its jumps and glides.",
			"The Exalted Air Volante's feet have bristle-like structures that help it adhere to a surface when it lands. This is particularly important for stabilization because the Exalted Air Volante expels gusts of air periodically.",
			"The Exalted Air Volante's digestive tract contains traces of various flying Morphopods, indicating that it is an aerial hunter.",
			"The Exalted Air Volante has a tube beneath its tail that is capable of expelling air at high speeds."
