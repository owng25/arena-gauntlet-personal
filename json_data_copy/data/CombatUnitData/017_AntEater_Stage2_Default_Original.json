	"DisplayName": "Verminio",

	"Intro": "While journeying through Taiga Boreal, one finds themselves captivated by the stark white landscape and the towering formations of ice and rock. The grandeur of the surroundings can be so overwhelming that it becomes difficult to spot the occasional flash of brilliant blue that appears and vanishes in an instant. This fleeting sight is likely the Verminio, slinking across the snow with its splendid tail making brief appearances.",
	"Summary": "This solitary creature has a long, agile body, dark mane, and a striking black and blue tail, moving on all fours with a downward-pointed elongated nose. Verminios exhibit remarkable agility, often helping smaller Vermillias escape danger by carrying them on their backs. Their physiology includes powerful noses for navigation and ice puncturing, temperature-sensitive tails, and padded claws for gripping icy surfaces.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Verminio boasts a long, agile body that skulks low to the ground, adorned with streaks of cream highlights along its brown fur. It moves on all fours, its elongated nose pointed downward, but its most striking features are its glowing eyes and tail. Its dark mane wraps around its upper torso, with thick black fur extending from the back of its head to its tail. Cutting through the snowy scene, its tail is nearly the same length as its body, trailing behind like a flickering flame of black and blue.",
		"Behaviour": "The Verminio is a solitary Illuvial, yet it occasionally offers smaller Vermillias a ride on its back to escape perilous situations. It might even scale mountains to assist those who find themselves stuck. Some Verminios exhibit more nurturing behavior toward Vermillias, and there have been instances where one allows Vermillias to clamber on its back for amusement. The Verminio is also known for its remarkable agility and ability to traverse treacherous terrain, skillfully navigating icy slopes and snow-laden crevices with ease. This incredible dexterity allows the Verminio to inhabit even the most remote and seemingly inaccessible locations within Taiga Boreal, thriving in areas where other creatures dare not venture."
