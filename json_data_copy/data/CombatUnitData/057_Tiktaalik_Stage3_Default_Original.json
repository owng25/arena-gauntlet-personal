	"DisplayName": "Geyyser",
	"DisplayDescription": "Geyyser propels a deluge of water into the sky, Healing all allies for <MaxHealth>200</> Health and dealing <AttackEnergyDamage>200</> Energy Damage to all enemies over 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nGeysser chooses not to Attack or Move, but converts all Attack Damage, Attack Speed, and Movement Speed into <OmegaPowerPercentage>Omega Power</> increasing the potency of its water eruptions.\r\n\r\nHeal: <MaxHealth>200</> (<OmegaPowerPercentage></>)\r\n\r\nDamage: <AttackEnergyDamage>200</> (<OmegaPowerPercentage></>)",
	"Intro": "Beneath the biggest waterfall in Halcyon Sea, there is a bottomless lake. The water crashing down on it has eroded the ground and created a deep, cold, and dark pit. Most Illuvials do not rest in this area to avoid the onslaught of water rushing down. The Geyyser is indifferent, soaking in the warm water at the surface, and the cooler currents down below, then expelling the water from the vents on its back.",
	"Summary": "The Geyyser, residing beneath Halcyon Sea's largest waterfalls, possesses an oversized, bloated body with extremely thick skin and prominent vents on its back. It absorbs warm surface water and cooler currents from below, expelling healing water through its vents. It exhibits an indifferent demeanor, rarely moving even in the face of danger, relying on its protective skin and emitting a callous snort to deter attackers.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Geyyser has extremely thick skin and a bulging body that is so bloated with water that it intimidates many other Illuvials. It has hardened vents rising from its back, and the ground around it is always soaked with life-giving water. The Geyyser's blue and white body is oversized and flexible, surging as it absorbs water and inflates its belly. It has two small eyes, one brown and one luminous blue, with a glowing ellipse upon its nose. Its flippers are coated in orange, like its vents, and dipped in bright healing blue. Its largest fin is flat and wide behind its pudgy tail, as vast as its aloof face. ",
		"Behaviour": "The Geyyser makes little to no effort to move away from danger, letting its coarse skin protect it from the elements. When other Illuvials attempt to attack it, it lets out a callous snort and unsettles them with its apathetic demeanour. The Geyyser has even more sensory receptors than its previous forms but it maintains the ability to numb its senses and maintain a calm disposition during battle. It rarely attempts to move or manipulate the regenerative water it creates. Regardless of whether its allies are in need of help, the Geyyser allows its body's natural rhythm to determine when it expels its bountiful healing liquid. As a water feeder, it eats only the algae and microbes within the water."

	"Facts": {
		"Kol": [
			"The Geyyser appears uninterested in the conflict of others and has been observed snorting at those who attempt to attack it.",
			"The Geyyser rarely attempts to move, even if a storm or danger is approaching from a distance.",
			"The Geyyser does not appear to experience pain or fear even when it is under attack. Its careless disposition is unsettling even to those who overpower it."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Geyyser's rough skin protects it from the elements, but it also dulls its sensory receptors.",
			"The Geyyser has a specialised organ in its body that produces a fluid which stimulates the growth of synthesised stem cells, allowing them to rapidly heal.",
			"The Geyyser has interlocking scales and cartilage that work in unison with its vents to move through the water with an undulating motion.",
			"The Geyyser has thin ray bones, scales, and gills, similar to many aquatic morphopods. However, it also has sturdy wrist bones, thick ribs, and the lungs of four-legged land Illuvials, making it quite the enigmatic creature to categorize.",
			"The Geyyser's fins are half-legs, with enough musculoskeletal strength to support its body outside of water."
