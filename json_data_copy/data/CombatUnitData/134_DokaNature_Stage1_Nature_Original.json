	"Intro": "There are hidden caves in the devastating landscape of Shardbluff Labyrinth that preserve life from the cataclysms above. The winding paths into these hideouts seal themselves shut, pulled by the movement of Tentifung. Those who seek refuge may wander for weeks on end, seeking another way out. Fortunately, they are well-ventilated with air ducts and cracks in the wall created by the pounding of the Lesser Nature Doka.",
	"Summary": "This stocky Illuvial has dark green fur, vibrant fern markings, and a cloud of floating leaves and petals that light up when it strikes. Known for its powerful punches, the Lesser Nature Doka clears areas for new growth and forms triads to defend and train in its underground territory. Adaptations include a grassy head that absorbs healing bacteria, an internal ecosystem aiding digestion, and photosynthesis-powered arms for impactful strikes.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Lesser Nature Doka is a stocky Illuvial with a flat head, sturdy fists, and two feet planted firmly on the ground. It has dark green fur with a white underbelly, and its face is illuminated by vibrant fern markings above and under its pink eyes. Growing from its head are thick tendrils of grass, with a cloud of floating leaves and petals that follow its movements. They shine with the same light from the Lesser Nature Doka's claws when it strikes. Wide-set and packed with muscles, this fighter Illuvial has a slight belly and a thick tail to match.",
		"Behaviour": "The Lesser Nature Doka is constantly punching with its club-like arms, striking areas of decay to allow for new life to grow. It forms triads with others of its kind, training together and protecting a shared underground territory. Every year before winter falls, triads of Lesser Nature Doka fight together against rival groups. In these three-on-three battles, the winning team stays together while the losing team go their separate ways, training with other solitary Dokas. The Lesser Nature Doka rarely traverses near the lava streams of Shardbluff Labyrinth, keeping to its secret dwelling and surrounding areas."

		"Kol": [
			"The Lesser Nature Doka has such a powerful punch that it can form dents into rock walls and fracture them. It uses this ability to create space for plants to grow (which it can feed on later), and to form new chambers in its subterranean territory.",
			"The Lesser Nature Doka live in colonies that are separated into triads of three. It typically stays within its group to defend against the hoards of Fire and Earth Illuvials outside its territory.",
			"The Lesser Nature Doka's hair holds clusters of pollen and often attracts pollinating morphopods."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Lesser Nature Doka's grassy head is adapted to absorb healing bacteria from bioluminescent sources and recover its health.",
			"The Lesser Nature Doka has an internal ecosystem in its gut that grows bacteria, aiding its digestive processes.",
			"The Lesser Nature Doka has a photosynthesis-powered compression mechanism in its bicep which allows it to lock its arm in and release for maximum impact.",
			"The Lesser Nature Doka has microscopic hair on its feet which allows it to collect and distribute pollen.",
			"The Lesser Nature Doka has a specialised olfactory system that enables it to detect the pheromones of other Illuvials."
