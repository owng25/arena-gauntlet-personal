	"Intro": "The waterfalls in Halcyon Sea are wide and steep, giving way to the colourful pools of Baifan Stairs. The steady stream of water appears gentle from afar, but the currents from above can sweep away smaller Illuvials with ease. The Greater Water Grokko catches them before they are washed away, and tosses them to the serene lake below.",
	"Summary": "The Greater Water Grokko inhabits the Halcyon Sea, where it saves smaller Illuvials from strong waterfall currents. This burly creature has blue orb-like eyes, a bulbous head, and glowing blue knuckles, with thin fins and protective rocks on its body. It exhibits unique feeding behaviors, including bottom-feeding and filtering microorganisms. Observations highlight its vestigial fins, negative buoyancy achieved by ingesting stones, and a swim bladder for buoyancy control.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Greater Water Grokko is burly, rough, and round, with blue orb-like eyes and a bulbous head that makes up the entirety of its torso. Its big mouth opens up in the middle of its body, bottom fangs jutting out as it lumbers along on two feet. Thin blue fins line the top of its head and arms, while darker, sharper rocks give it extra protection along its body. The Greater Water Grokko has a flat nose and dull senses, but its glowing blue knuckles are able to wear down its opponent as it withstands the most brutal attacks. With a thick tail that acts as a counterweight for its heavy body, it can stand on its hind legs in a bipedal stance.",
		"Behaviour": "The Greater Water Grokko ambles along, headstrong with its feet planted firmly in the sand underwater. It does not avoid the territory of other Illuvials and goes where it wishes. It stands its ground even when it is clearly outmatched, perhaps out of tenacity, or perhaps stupidity. This stubbornness makes it intimidating to other Illuvials, and even those more powerful begin to doubt their skills when the Greater Water Grokko refuses to back down. It does not appear to tire, bullheaded from the moment it awakens until death. Although it does not appear to sleep, it may curl up in a ball to roll down hills or to protect itself from intense storms. This enigmatic Illuvial is a bottom feeder that opens its mouth to capture aquatic Morphopods, uncaring if other debris drifts into its digestive tract."

	"Facts": {
		"Kol": [
			"The Greater Water Grokko's fins on its head and hands appear to be vestigial features, as the Greater Water Grokko does not glide underwater and walks upon the seafloor. It often ingests stones to gain weight and obtain a negative buoyancy.",
			"The Greater Water Grokko has been observed to put a variety of objects in its mouth, often crunching shells, coral, trees, and even the lithic textures on its skin only to regenerate them again. After absorbing nutrients from the materials, it spits them back out in liquid forms.",
			"The Greater Water Grokko can swallow large amounts of water, which give it its bulging shape."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Greater Water Grokko is a filter feeder with many bristles inside its chin, which allows it to filter microorganisms from the seawater that enters its mouth.",
			"The Greater Water Grokko has a swim bladder that allows it to control its buoyancy.",
			"The Greater Water Grokko's fins are adapted to change in shape underwater, providing stabilization and assisting movements.",
			"The Greater Water Grokko's stomach is adaptable to different materials and its immune system develops defence mechanisms based on what it ingests.",
			"The Greater Water Grokko has an immense weight of 1680 kg, with vestigial fins and coral growths upon its body."
