	"DisplayName": "Fludd",
	"DisplayDescription": "Fludd propels a deluge of water into the sky, Healing all allies for <MaxHealth>160</> Health and dealing <AttackEnergyDamage>160</> Energy Damage to all enemies over 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nFludd chooses not to Attack or Move, but converts all Attack Damage, Attack Speed, and Movement Speed into <OmegaPowerPercentage>Omega Power</> increasing the potency of its water eruptions.\r\n\r\nHeal: <MaxHealth>160</> (<OmegaPowerPercentage></>)\r\n\r\nDamage: <AttackEnergyDamage>160</> (<OmegaPowerPercentage></>)",
	"Intro": "Below the steepest waterfall in Halcyon Sea, water pools gathered along wide, rocky steppes. A mix of coral and rock populates these multicoloured reservoirs, and they absorb their chroma from the dominant microorganism within each pool. The Fludd, who trudges along on its sloppy flippers, absorbed these nutrients within these waters.",
	"Summary": "The Fludd is a bulky Illuvial with a sponge-like body designed for absorbing and expelling water. It features distinctive teal vents on its back for expelling healing water, contrasting with its somber demeanor and mismatched eyes ? one bright, one ordinary brown. Despite its shy nature and preference to avoid conflict by hiding behind its flippers or coral, the Fludd can intimidate others by absorbing water to increase its size.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Fludd appears to be a pile of blubber with fins, but it is a vessel for water with incredible restorative abilities. It has fat rolls along its dark blue and white body, a round cream underbelly for storing liquid, and teal chimney-like vents along its humped back for spouting them. It sits on its behind, with its lower flippers splayed apart on the ground and its tail behind it. Its upper flippers droop out in front of it, orange and blue, dripping with a glowing light. Its right eye shines just as bright as the healing water it produces from its vents, while its left eye remains an ordinary brown. The Fludd's broad head is frequently downcast, and its wide mouth is set in a glum expression.",
		"Behaviour": "The Fludd frequently experiences headaches from the pressure building up inside its absorbent body, and it can be found holding its head in pain. It is a capable swimmer that propels itself forward by expelling water, but it cannot move well outside of the ocean. Perpetually downcast, the Fludd pushes away the Ebb's attempts to play, turning its body away from the younger Illuvial. The Fludd cannot control the erupting deluge of water from its vents when liquid builds up inside its body. Hiding its face with its flippers, the Fludd prefers to avoid conflict. When cornered, it may intimidate other Illuvials by absorbing water to make itself bigger. This quick intake of water is also used to filter liquid in search of microbes."

	"Facts": {
		"Kol": [
			"The Fludd absorbs high amounts of water and increases its body weight when it is under stress. It may spurt water from its vents to catch morphopods or to defend itself.",
			"The Fludd has two different coloured eyes, one adapted for seeing underwater and the other on land.",
			"The Fludd is quite shy and covers its eyes when it feels other Illuvials staring at it. It avoids conflict by hiding its face with its flippers or behind coral structures."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Fludd has an ultra-absorbent, sponge-like body that can fill up to three times its entire weight.",
			"The Fludd's skeletal system has bones of varying density to support movement on land and in water.",
			"The Fludd has internal water sacs dedicated to water propulsion, supporting its movement in the water.",
			"The Fludd's body is specially adapted with multiple inner valves to manage the water pressure building up inside it.",
			"The Fludd's skull is low and flat, with spiracle openings on its surface leading to its versatile respiratory system, which is connected to both gills and a rudimentary set of lungs."
