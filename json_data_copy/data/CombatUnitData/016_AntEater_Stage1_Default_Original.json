	"DisplayName": "Vermillia",
	"DisplayDescription": "Vermillia spins its tail, creating a gale of wind and gaining <AttackDodgeChancePercentage>10</> Dodge Chance for 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nVermillia then thrashes its tail, dealing <AttackEnergyDamage>500</> (<OmegaPowerPercentage></>) Energy Damage to enemies within 22-hexes and reducing their Omega Power by <OmegaPowerPercentage>25</> for 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nDamage: <AttackEnergyDamage>500</> (<OmegaPowerPercentage></>)",
	"Intro": "In the frosty mountain ranges of Taiga Boreal, the biting winds can be merciless to withstand. This unyielding cold may deceive an explorer's mind, leading them to witness a wondrous phenomenon of swirling lights, only to realize that the spectacle may not be coming from above. In truth, such a display could be the dazzling tail of the Vermillia as it dashes about, leaping into the air and rolling down icy hills with delight.",
	"Summary": "This creature, with its red eyes and sensitive fur, moves swiftly on all fours, using its curling trunk to gather scents. Known for playful combat and social behavior, Vermillias collaborate to hunt and engage in communal activities like constructing snowballs. Their unique physiological traits include large lungs, padded feet, and a tail that senses environmental changes, aiding in their high-speed travel and acrobatic attacks.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Vermillia, with its luminous red eyes and extravagant tail, moves swiftly, leaving only tiny footprints in the snow. Its tail, a vibrant mix of black and blue, is its most distinguishing feature and mirrors the flair that adorns the creature's angular head. Its small, furry brown and white torso may seem unassuming, but the tufts of long fur on the Vermillia appear to possess a keen degree of sensitivity. Walking on all fours, the Vermillia's curling trunk seems to vacuum up a medley of scents.",
		"Behaviour": "The Vermillia revels in playful combat, frequently leaping and swinging its tail around. Vermillia often gather in groups, engaging in activities and cooperating to move large quantities of morphopods into a central feeding area. Their communal activities extend beyond hunting, encompassing diverse rituals such as constructing snowballs, swishing their tails in unison, or even stealthily approaching larger Illuvials and overwhelming them with sheer numbers."

	"Facts": {
		"Kol": [
			"The Vermillia uses its large tail to create an air cushion under its body to help it run faster.",
			"Vermillias are social creatures who work together, often collaborating to move large amounts of morphopods into one central feeding area.",
			"The Vermillia's breath is often visible in a variety of climates."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Vermillia's trunk is adapted to maintain a moderate internal temperature, capable of heating up cold air before it reaches its lungs and cooling off intense steam to keep them from burning its body.",
			"The Vermillia's fur functions as a biological optical fibre, allowing the sun's energy to reach its skin more efficiently.",
			"The Vermillia has extremely large lungs and extra air cavities that allow it to store excess air and expel it when necessary.",
			"The Vermillia's tail can sense slight shifts in the speed, direction and temperature of oncoming wind.",
			"The Vermillia has padded feet which offer extra protection for travelling at high speeds across rough terrain, especially in low temperatures."
