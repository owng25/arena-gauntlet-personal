Allies gain <DamageAmplification>15%</> (<OmegaPowerPercentage></>) Damage Amp for 4 seconds, while enemies take <AttackEnergyDamage>200</> (<OmegaPowerPercentage></>) Energy Damage and are Stunned for 1.25 seconds.\r\n\r\nDamage Amp: <DamageAmplification>15%</> (<OmegaPowerPercentage></>\r\n<AttackEnergyDamage>200</> (<OmegaPowerPercentage></>)",
	"Intro": "In the shimmering expanse of Crystal Shores, where lightning-struck dunes create floating shards and underground oases hide beneath slight drops, the Aapon cuts an imposing figure. From agile climbers to knuckle-walking behemoths, these remarkable beings navigate the glistening landscape with a blend of physical might and psionic prowess. Their massive boulder tails and glowing features make them unmistakable amidst the refracting sunlight and crystal formations.",
	"Summary": "The Aapon appears in three distinct forms, each showcasing adaptation to Crystal Shores' unique environment. The smallest type is an nimble climber, while the largest is a formidable presence with telepathic abilities. Each form is characterised by increasing size, complexity of psionic abilities, and the development of their signature feature: a massive, levitating boulder tail. The Aapon's fur ranges from pristine white to crystal blue and indigo, with bioluminescent patterns growing more intricate in larger specimens. These creatures display a mix of solitary meditation and protective behaviours, their psionic abilities allowing for complex interactions with their environment and other Illuvials.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Aapon's physiology is a marvel of psionic energy manipulation. The smallest Aapon have rock-plated forearms, a glowing centre horn, and a massive boulder tail that hovers just off the ground. Their white fur and long, gripping toes aid in climbing crystal formations. Mid-sized Aapon develop a more athletic build with blue and grey colouring. Their chests are marked by glowing pink lines, matching the illumination from cracks in their rocky forearms and enormous tails. The largest Aapon boast crystal blue and indigo fur with swirling brown markings. Their long, curved horns and monolithic tails are surrounded by floating slabs and orbs of light. All Aapon possess eyes that emit a pink glow, serving both as a light source and a conduit for their psionic abilities. As they increase in size, they develop more complex energy manipulation skills, with the largest capable of creating and controlling orbs of light and matter. The Aapon swings its massive boulder tail with practiced precision, striking objects and energy orbs with remarkable accuracy. The smallest Aapon often use this technique to dislodge crystal formations or stun prey, while larger specimens can generate impressive force, sending energy spheres hurtling across vast distances. Their control is so fine-tuned that they can adjust the angle and power of each strike, causing their targets to ricochet off crystal walls at calculated trajectories.",
		"Behaviour": "The Aapon's behaviour evolves with its size, showcasing increasing psionic prowess and strategic thinking. The smallest Aapon are often seen scaling elaborate spiralling structures to meditate atop high points. They carefully manage their tails to prevent structural damage and prefer solitude to minimise psychic interference. Mid-sized Aapon are more socially inclined, offering protection and healing to companions in exchange for help with grooming and debris removal. They move by knuckle-walking and use their psionic abilities to levitate crystal shards and create dazzling light displays. The largest Aapon display the most complex behaviour. They prefer the calm of underground caves, using orbs of light for navigation. Their telepathic abilities allow them to form psychic bridges into the minds of other Illuvials, accessing memories and forming deep connections. Despite their varying sizes, all Aapon share a need for regular rest and meditation to manage their considerable energy reserves. They use their psionic abilities for hunting and defence, environmental manipulation, and even artistic expression through crude rock sculptures or light displays."

	"Facts": {
		"Kol": [
			"The Greater Aapon pounds its big fists on the ground as a warning to those who threaten those under its care. It protects the Illuvials in its territory and occasionally even grooms crystal fragments from their bodies.",
			"The Greater Aapon can be found hurling orbs of light against crystal walls at specific angles, creating a dazzling reflective light display that attracts the Morphopods it feeds upon.",
			"The Greater Aapon's tail pulses with an energy that can levitate other crystal shards or rocks. The Greater Aapon must regularly clear its tail of extra debris."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Greater Aapon's body is plated with rocks composed of a Pallvium-Gallavium alloy, a resilient material that offers physical protection but also emits high levels of radiation.",
			"The Greater Aapon's brain is of comparable size and density to a Valain's. The results of neural mapping indicate it has a capacity for processing complex emotions of curiosity, kinship, and grief.",
			"The Greater Aapon's body pulsates with intense radioactive energy that has left visible scars on its chest.",
			"The Greater Aapon's palms are specially adapted to lock onto balls of radioactive energy, maintaining their spherical form until it releases them towards its target.",
			"The Greater Aapon has a regenerative organ with fast-tracked healing properties that can be distributed towards other Illuvials."
