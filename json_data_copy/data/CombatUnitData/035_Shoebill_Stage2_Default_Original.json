	"Intro": "Brightland Steppes is full of grassy hills and colourful little flowers that sway in the wind. A place of peace and tranquillity, the fields make a soft resting place for inhabitants and visitors to lie. However, one must be careful not to pick a patch of land that belongs to Fernite. Guarded and territorial, the Fernite does not tolerate trespassers.",
	"Summary": "With a body resembling a tall plant, the Fernite's vibrant red and green plumage, combined with its tendril-like vines and trident-tipped tail, make it a striking figure. Social creatures, Fernites form tight-knit flocks, displaying extreme loyalty and aggression towards outsiders while sacrificing for their group. Their wings can repel intruders and hunt prey, and their feathers contain enzymes that aid in healing, showing a deep connection with their ecosystem.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Fernite's body is wrapped with tendrils of brown vine that hang green feathers across its chest and stomach and frames its face like a helmet above its red brow. Easily mistaken for a tall plant, the Fernite's red and green plumage often attracts other creatures. It often snaps its giant yellow beak and shakes the large, leafy feathers that fan out from the sides of its head, shoulders, and wings. The base of these green feathers is autumn red like the plumage of its chest and its long trident-tipped tail, which resembles the three sharp petals of a predatory plant. The Fernite's lower body has zigzag streaks of orange and yellow, and its forest green legs are bark brown at their base.",
		"Behaviour": "The Fernite is a social Illuvial that forms large groups that flock together in the face of danger. Fernites are highly aggressive towards Illuvials outside their flock, defending their territory by sweeping their wings and slinging leaves to blow trespassers away. It also hunts flying Morphopods with this ability. With a dual nature, the Fernite acts with extreme altruism towards those on its side and brutal vehemence towards the opposition. It is willing to sacrifice its life for its flock and has such a high level of connection with its companions that it can predict their movements."

	"Facts": {
		"Kol": [
			"The Fernite screeches at trespassers and vigorously flaps its wings, creating a barrier of wind that repels any creature who approaches.",
			"The Fernite often picks off loose feathers from its wings and gifts them to another Fernite in its flock. Fernites wear the feathers of their companions with pride.",
			"The Fernite only craves the company of those in their flock, behaving aggressively towards strange Fernites and other creatures in its territory."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Fernite has a highly developed immune system that can rapidly heal wounds and fight off infections.",
			"The Fernite's feathers contain an enzyme that triggers the rapid transfer of nutrients to and from other living things.",
			"The Fernite secretes specialised cells created through a symbiotic relationship with bioluminescent bacteria which enable it to restore the health of living things with a blast of its wings.",
			"The Fernite's brain gives off a frequency which is capable of connecting with other Fernites and nature Illuvials.",
			"The Fernite has a powerful beak that can swallow small Illuvials whole, as evidenced by traces found in its digestive tract. The Fernite's diet consists mostly of various plants and morphopods supplemented by occasional Illuvials."
