	"Intro": "There's always a gentle breeze in Brightland Steppes, which sends seeds and bubbles sailing through the air. They drift above ponds and grassy fields, passing colourful flowers and dense shrubbery. A bubble floats into a leafy bush, and a branch waves it off. Wait a minute? two pitch-black eyes stare out from the greenery. It's not a plant, but the Fern is hidden among the foliage.",
	"Summary": "In the Brightland Steppes, the Fern blends into the environment with its vibrant feathers and plant-like appearance, making it difficult to spot. Its physiology includes a striking red head, a crown of feather-like blooms, and a large yellow bill used for grooming. The Fern is known for its vanity, often preening excessively and striking elaborate poses to showcase its colorful plumage. It exhibits unique behaviors such as collecting and crushing red flora for its nest and using its plumage for photosynthesis.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Fern's head is red like a ripened fruit, and the crown of feathers upon its head resembles a flower about to bloom. Its feathers are pride and joy, flaring crimson around its neck and lively green along its wings. The Fern's white pin pupils and unblinking black eyes often catch others by surprise. That's because its leafy wings and branch-like legs make it hard to spot among the bushes, especially when it stands still. The Fern's big yellow bill is often used for grooming its many layers of beautiful feathers.",
		"Behaviour": "The Fern loves to preen and will bend over backwards for admiration from others of its kind. It stands in elaborate, artful and comedic poses to show off its vibrant colours in inventive ways. If it sees a flower that it thinks rivals its beauty, it will pluck it off and destroy it. The Fern grooms itself excessively, sometimes to the point of damaging its own feathers. It is capable of standing so still that Morphopods wander in its vicinity as easy prey."

	"Facts": {
		"Kol": [
			"The Fern is a proud creature that spends hours grooming daily, nipping every feather with its beak. When it is satisfied, it spreads its wings to flaunt its colours.",
			"The Fern often stands still in positions that show off its vibrant plumage. It remains silent and pecks at those who disturb the peace, or morphopod prey that has wandered too close.",
			"The Fern plucks red flowers, leaves, and mushrooms to create a crimson collection for its nest. It uses its feet to crush them and dye its chest."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Fern's green plumage can perform photosynthesis and its feathers tilt in the direction of the sun.",
			"The Fern's large beak is capable of picking up large quantities of fruit and begins the process of digestion with its acidic saliva. The fruits ferment in its digestive systems, producing natural alcohol.",
			"The Fern's field of vision spans 180 degrees with feathers around its neck that are so sensitive to vibrations, it can detect movement from all directions.",
			"The Fern has large quantities of leaf-eating morphopods in its digestive system and leaf-like growths within its feathers, suggesting a symbiotic relationship with the plants in its ecosystem.",
			"The Fern is relatively heavy, and considering the size of its wings compared to its body mass, it would only be capable of short-distance flight."
