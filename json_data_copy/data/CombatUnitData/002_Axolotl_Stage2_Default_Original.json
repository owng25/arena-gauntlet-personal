	"Intro": "Despite its stunning beauty, the Halcyon Sea has an array of caves, coves, and inlets that can be treacherous. One misstep is all it takes to slip into the grasp of something ominous below. This aquatic paradise abounds with majestic waterfalls that often obscure what lurks beneath. Among the colourful coral-filled region, one should be mindful to look out for the brazen Axon. ",
	"Summary": "The Axon prowls the treacherous caves and inlets of the Halcyon Sea, its bright blue skin and cream underbelly providing a deceptively beautiful appearance. This fierce Illuvial possesses a triangular head crowned with red horns and a massive whip-like tail that serves as a third leg for stability. The Axon's territorial nature is evident in its frequent patrols, marking its domain with a potent, headache-inducing scent. With exceptional climbing abilities and silent swimming skills, it navigates both rushing waterfalls and underwater currents with ease, often startling unsuspecting passersby.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Axon is a fierce beast with long limbs and a whip-like tail, which can lash out at any moment. Its tail is so huge that it can be used as a third leg for more stability. It has bright blue skin and a cream underbelly, with splotches of darker blue on its face. Crowned with red horns, its triangular head sits atop a muscular torso. A dark red fin travels down its back and fans out around both sides of its enormous tail. The Axon can stand on its two hind legs; its webbed feet planted firmly on the ground with its hands ready to maul.",
		"Behaviour": "The Axon often sniffs around and peers at others with suspicion. It patrols its territory frequently, rubbing its glands upon coral structures to mark them with its scent. The Axon is distant and aloof to all others except for the Atlas. It stands up on two feet when confronting danger and stays on all fours when it is at ease. A silent swimmer, the Axon often sneaks up on those near open water, startling them when it emerges. It is capable of travelling up and down any waterway, regardless of the current."

	"Facts": {
		"Kol": [
			"The Axon routinely marks its territory with a horrible, headache-inducing smell as a warning to those who wander too close.",
			"The Axon can produce a variety of sounds using its tongue and vocal sac, including a high-pitched scream (likely for echolocation), and a bursting cry that blasts water from its face. Most bizarre of all, it is capable of making a low and warped, hypnotic rumble that lingers in one's mind, capable of causing nausea that can rupture the eardrums of other Illuvials underwater.",
			"The Axon has superb climbing abilities, with a firm grip that allows it to grasp wet rocks and allows it to scale heavy waterfalls with ease. Its razor-sharp claws can leave deep cracks within coral and rock, allowing them to climb up vertical inclines with ease."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Axon's tail contains fourteen pairs of muscles which are capable of propelling the Axon forward in the water.",
			"The Axon has stores of hyper-regenerative cells that enable it to grow back the entire length of its tail within a day.",
			"The Axon has tiny vents on its body that open when submerged, expelling water and enabling it to move quickly and efficiently. These openings are the reason the Axon makes hiccup-like noises and a distinct, croak-like groan.",
			"The Axon's large tail has more mass than three of its other limbs combined. Its tail can easily be used as a third tail to increase its stability when it stands.",
			"The Axon's dense skull provides protection for the external gills at the back of its head."
