	"Intro": "The sands of Crystal Shores are made of fine crystal dust grounded down from the many glittering structures in the region. There are millions of shard pieces in the Crystal dunes that are worn down from weather and time. However, many of them are still sharp enough to injure the creatures of this region. Fortunately, the Lesser Earth Atippo can heal itself easily, so it continues playing without a care, scooping sand into its horn.",
	"Summary": "The Lesser Earth Atippo inhabits Crystal Shores, and uses its large scoop-shaped horn to play and gather sand. Distinguished by its purple, rock-textured horn and a vibrant pink orb, the Atippo has rock plates on its body and stout legs with small black claws. The Atippo's horn functions as an antenna for detecting vibrations, and it communicates using high-frequency sounds, while its abilities include blasting light at opponents and granting allies energy boosts.",
	"Biology": {
		"Physiology": "The Lesser Earth Atippo's crowning glory is a large, scoop-shaped horn on its head that's roughly the same size as the rest of its body. It balloons out like a collapsed mushroom, purple in colour with a knobbed grooved texture the texture of rock. Floating above the horn is a vibrant pink orb, pulsing with light just like the luminous dots drifting from its equally pink tail. Its back is covered with rock plates and there are other smaller plates on various parts of its body. Standing on four stout legs with small black claws, the Lesser Earth Atippo looks up with its yellow eyes, twitching its thin ears.",
		"Behaviour": "The Lesser Earth Atippo is a playful Illuvial who enjoys shooting floating shards out of the sky, and hunting Morphopods on the crystals. It can be found digging up sand with its horn and creating makeshift craters to rest in. Occasionally, the Lesser Earth Atippo builds mounds of sand and crystal shards with others of its kind, working together to gather special fragments across the region. These distinct crystals attract Morphopod prey, allowing them to hunt large quantities of prey together."

	"Facts": {
		"Kol": [
			"The Lesser Earth Atippo leaves patterned grooves in the dunes as it walks. Although these markings disappear quickly with the wind, when another Illuvial comes across it, they are more likely to stop and rest there.",
			"The Lesser Earth Atippo gathers in groups to collect sand and crystal shards into massive mounds. Some of the biggest dunes in Crystal Shores were created by Earth Atippos.",
			"The Lesser Earth Atippo spends most of its time lying down, sinking in the sand to cool down its body."
		],
		"Buckley": [
			"The Lesser Earth Atippo's respiratory system functions by taking in crystal dust from the air through its horn and using an internal pressure valve to produce and release bacteria into the sand.",
			"The Lesser Earth Atippo's luminous orb can emit a layer of sound that is a higher frequency than the hearing range of most organic life forms, allowing it to communicate discreetly with others of its kind.",
			"The Lesser Earth Atippo's scoop-shaped horn processes vibratory sensations and functions as a large antenna for detecting the electromagnetic impulse of life around it. The closer it is to the ground, the stronger the vibrations and the richer the natural sound it detects.",
			"The Lesser Earth Atippo has mineral deposits infused in its skeleton that increase its density and lower its center of gravity.",
			"The Lesser Earth Atippo's internal organs are protected by a layer of earth and stone. This form of protection can be compromised by too much moisture, which can bloat the Lesser Earth Atippo and affect its efficiency."
